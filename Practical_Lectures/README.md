# Practical Lectures

This folder contains the steps done in the Practical Lectures of the seminar based on the computer science (INF) group. They should help if you want to retype some of the commands or if you missed a lecture.<br>
You can execute the commands on Linux-based operating systems like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, etc., and most of them also on macOS. If you are using Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or install a virtual Linux-based OS via VirtualBox. You can install WSL by using the following command inside the Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell:
<pre>wsl --install</pre>
